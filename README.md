# Jepeto Compiler

In this project, we developed a compiler for the Jepeto programming language entirely from scratch using Java. Jepeto includes a wide range of features commonly found in popular programming languages, such as computational, logical, and comparative operators, function definitions and calls, flow control mechanisms, scoping, and an additional featureâ€”Anonymous Functions.

The compiler consists of several key modules typical of a standard compiler architecture:

* Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
* Code Generator
* Name Analyzer
* Type Checker
* Visitor
* Grammar processor

We utilized a variety of tools throughout the development process, including Java, ANTLR, and Jasmin, to handle tasks ranging from grammar validation to bytecode generation.
